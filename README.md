# vps-provision
Another experiment to provision my VPS

## Disclaimer
I am new to `Ansible` and am simply trying to get my VPS provisioned without installing anything by SSH-ing into the machine.

## Goal
My goal for this exercise is to have at least the following things working:

- Jupyter Notebook
- Spark

More to follow.
